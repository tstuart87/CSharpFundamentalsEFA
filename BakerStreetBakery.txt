A client, Mrs.Hudson, has asked us to make a console application for her bakery.
She is going to use it as a register system to enter customer orders
Create a new console application. We are going to name this 
BakerStreetBakery.

Create a class in this assembly that we name Product
The client has specified that she organizes her products 
based on type Bread, Cake, Pastery, Pies (We should probably use an enum here. Maybe name it public enum BakeType{})
string ProductName
string CustomerName
int OrderBatchSize
decimal OrderCost

(Don't forget about your constructors)

We don't need to unit test the properties for this program.
Once you have created the class with your properties create a class
for your repository name this class ProductRepository
We need a method to: 
	add to a list
	get the list
	remove from list
	and print the list to view (we have not discussed this yet).


She also wants to charge an initial $100 per order and add an additional 
$500.01 for bread, $2000 for cake, $200.10 for pasteries, and $851.5 for pies(This method should be in our repo)

Once you create your object class and repo, unit test the methods in your 
repository. Do this in a new Unit Test Project name this 
BakerStreetBakery_Tests.

If you completed the repository we should have 3 Unit Tests in our unit test project.
Next create a class named ProgramUI. 
Create a method named Run(). Go back to the Program class and create an 
instance of ProgramUI in the static void main method and call the Run method. 
ProgramUI program = new ProgramUI();
program.Run();

Write a user interface with a menu for the user which is our client to enter a order from a customer. 
They need to enter the name of the product such as Cinnamon Roll or Wedding Cake
The amount needed for the order. 
The cost will be calculated based on type (our method in the repository).
