We have a really rich guy come to us requesting to build the next big thing. 
He wants to stream video/tv shows/music information. 

For right now he just wants a console application for proof of concept.
He wants to be able to:
	Add a movie
	Read info about movie
	Edit the movie
	Delete the movie

He would also like to be able to store multiple movie when he runs the application.
He would like this completed by Tuesday of next week.


For our Projects/Assembly types we need a Unit Test Project, a Console Application Project,
and a Class Library Project.





Edit movie.
